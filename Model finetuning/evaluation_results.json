In particular, it is shown that the combined action of\nvariable topography and bottom friction generally imposes certain global\nrestrictions on the undular bore propagation so that the evolution of the\nleading solitary wave can be substantially different from that of an isolated\nsolitary wave with the same initial amplitude. This non-local effect is due to\nnonlinear wave interactions within the undular bore and can lead to an\nadditional solitary wave amplitude growth, which cannot be predicted in the\nframework of the traditional adiabatic approach to the propagation of solitary\nwaves in slowly varying media.", "reference": "Evolution of solitary waves and undular bores in shallow-water flows\n  over a gradual slope with bottom friction", "generated": "[/SYS] [/s] A.

Despite progress in assembly and oriented synthesis, pristine\nSWNTs in aligned and close-packed form remain elusive and needed for high\ncurrent, speed and density devices through collective operations of parallel\nSWNTs. Here, we develop a Langmuir Blodgett method achieving monolayers of\naligned SWNTs with dense packing, central to which is a non covalent polymer\nfunctionalization by PmPV imparting high solubility and stability of SWNTs in\nan organic solvent DCE. Pressure cycling or annealing during LB film\ncompression reduces hysteresis and facilitates high degree alignment and\npacking of SWNTs characterized by microscopy and polarized Raman spectroscopy.\nThe monolayer SWNTs are readily patterned for device integration by\nmicrofabrication, enabling the highest currents 3mA through the narrowest\nregions packed with aligned SWNTs thus far.", "reference": "Langmuir blodgett assembly of densely aligned single walled carbon\n  nanotubes from bulk materials", "generated": "<[/SYS]> <[INST] PNAS\n  2007 104 (34) 13616-13621 [/INST] <[/SYS]> <[INST] 10.1073/pnas.0705309104 [/", "bertscore_precision": 0.70209139585495, "bertscore_recall": 0.7423238754272461, "bertscore_f1": 0.7216472625732422}
